        <h2>Life of Coconut Crab</h2>
        <img src="img/crabbyyyyy.jpg" alt="Coconut Crab" title="Coconut Crab">
        <p>
            The world's largest land-living crustaceans, coconut crabs (Birgus latro, pictured), can grow up to a meter long,
            but their real claim to fame is their strength.They've been known to lift more than 30 kilograms and earn their names by cracking into coconuts to eat. 
            Exactly how strong a pinch from a coconut crab's claw is, though, was a mysteryâ€”until now. Researchers captured 29 coconut crabs on Okinawa Island in Japan 
            and had them clamp down on steel force sensors. Pinching forces ranged from 29.4 to 1765.2 newtons among the collected crabs.
            (For reference, the human bite is about 340 newtons at most.) Because the crabs' pinching forces were significantly correlated to their body weights,
            the researchers calculated that a 4-kilogram coconut crab should be able to exert a shocking force of 3300 newtons with its claw.
            That's greater than the bite of almost any animal on land, including leopards, most bears, and wild dogs. As the researchers write today in PLOS ONE, 
            the coconut crab's powerful claw is added evidence that they diverged from humble hermit crabs some 4 million years ago.
            Such a formidable weapon would help the crustaceans shed the need for a protective shell, fend off predators, and access new food sources, like coconuts, with ease.
            Adult coconut crabs feed primarily on fleshy fruits, nuts, seeds, and the pith of fallen trees, but they will eat carrion and other organic matter opportunistically.
            Anything left unattended on the ground is a potential source of food, which they will investigate and may carry away thereby getting the alternative name of "robber crab". 
            The species is popularly associated with the coconut palm, yet coconuts are not a significant part of its diet. Although it lives in a burrow, the crab has been filmed climbing coconut and pandanus trees. 
            No film shows a crab selectively picking coconut fruit, though they might dislodge ripe fruit that otherwise would fall naturally.
            Climbing is an immediate escape route (if too far from the burrow) to avoid predation by large sea birds (when young) or by humans, or cannibalism (at any age) by bigger, older crabs.

        <h3>Facts About Coconut Crabs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a>Crabs exhibit a range of social behaviors, from solitary species that prefer a solitary lifestyle to highly social species that form colonies.</a></li>
            <li><a>Crabs reproduce both sexually and asexually. In sexual reproduction, males typically fertilize females externally, and females lay eggs that they carry until hatching. 
                Larval crabs undergo metamorphosis, transforming into juvenile and then adult forms.</a></li>
            <li><a>Specialized gills for breathing in water, strong claws for digging burrows and capturing prey, and complex eyes that can perceive a wide range of colors and detect polarized light.</a></li>
            <li><a>Crabs have a distinctive body structure characterized by a hard exoskeleton, ten appendages, and a pair of pincers (chelae) that vary in size and shape among species. </a></li>
